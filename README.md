# Variant-Watcher
JN to aggregate IOC's from a target Malware Variant

# To do

[ ] Add in relevant API calls to pull info in general.
[ ] Add in filter to specify what family/variant you would like to request IOCs on such as 
- Inputting Redline
- Pulls top domains seen in last x days
- Pulls top IPs seen in last x days
- Pulls top hashes/file IOC seen in last x days

Steps rough:

Test with a simple free API, such as malware bazar (look at how splunk did it kind of)
Test with multiple and format the data as required.
